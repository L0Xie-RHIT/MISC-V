Tuesday, Oct3

Work:
Design doc outline, design philosohy, performance definition, memory map. Some contribution in ISA implementation discussion.

Decisions:
Philosohy of fuctionality first, memory map of 3 segemtns, performance is speed, should have been 4 instruction types (now is 5).

Memory Design Process:
16-bit address bus 0xFFFF or 65536 addresses
Minimum needed: Instruction Memory + Data Memory
32 lines for Euclid, each 16 bit. 
Decision: Word size one byte. 
2 addresses for each instruction, 64 minimum
Decision: 
2^13 = 8192 = 0x2000 for instruction memory
2^12 = 4096 = 0x1000 reserved
The rest is data

Next week tasks:
Finish design doc

Sunday, Oct8 - Wednesday, Oct11

Work:
Finished memory map, procedure call convention, translation of RelPrime to binary. RTL design of Y type. Some contribution in other RTL implementation discussion.

Decisions:
Procesure call convention based on RISC-V but adapted to our ISA. For pipelining RTL for branch save to PC might need changing.

Next week tasks:
Setup github repo, basic verilog code.
